- 👋 Hi, I’m @christofalpo
- 👀 I’m interested in Open Source, Linux, C/C++, Rust, Python, PostgreSQL and a lot more. I'd love to work on cryptography, basic network functionality and linux kernel programming. I dream about a sustainable world, where energy is freely available.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust at a basic level, haven't had much time to do that the last few years. I try to read Linux Weekly News every week, though it does slip now and then.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project where my skills can be used and refined.
- 📫 How to reach me: Try my email -> christofal7235@gmail.com
